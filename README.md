# Stream&lt;Java&gt;

There are a number of people out there live-streaming their Javawork with Java (or other JVM-based languages) but it's not easy to find them.
This repo spawns a website that shows a calendar of `Stream<Java>` (get it, "streams of Java"? :D ) at [streamofjava.tv](https://streamofjava.tv/).
